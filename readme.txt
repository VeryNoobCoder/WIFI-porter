Some networks may block ARP requests or require additional privileges, which could hinder the script.

The code relies on Python libraries (scapy, socket) which are cross-platform, but tools like scapy are particularly well-supported on Kali Linux due to its penetration-testing focus.

It attempts to resolve hostnames and scan for open ports on identified devices, which could reveal information about running services or applications.

The code uses ARP requests to identify devices on the same local network (e.g., devices connected to the same Wi-Fi or Ethernet).
